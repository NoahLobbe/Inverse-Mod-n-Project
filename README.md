# Inverse-Mod-n-Project
Project to calculate Mod-n inverses

I made this for a High School Specialists Maths investigation which went into Matrices through encryption/decryption, requiring inverse Mod-n numbers.

Version 1.5 is currently the most completed version. It contains 2 variables near the top for developer debugging, so replace their values with `True` as required.
